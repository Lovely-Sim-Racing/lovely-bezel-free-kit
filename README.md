## DIY Bezel Free Kit 
I found myself with a broken TV and after learning about the Lenticular film inside of it, I decided that I needed to make myself a Bezel Free Kit for my triples. Unfortunatley, I do not have a 3D printer nor would I bother accessing one (yet). I tried to find alternative options to the ASUS RIOG Bezel Free Kit mounts, but still was not really happy with the avaialble options. So, I did what I like to do the most... I got creative.

I had some foamcore board laying around (yeah, I make things), and if you've ever used it before, you'll know how easy it is to cut but also how rigid it is. So, this was my first go-to material. And it worked. I later tweaked the design and added two layers for extra rigidity. 

I made some changes to how I mounted the actual Lenticular film and eventually I resolved to the template below. Obviously these mounts fit ***any*** screen size, as long as you have a large enough lenticular film.


## Ingredients
This is a DIY project, and as such you will need to source the materials yourself to get this done.

![Ingredients](images/ingredients.png)

The star of the project is the Lenticular film which can be found in any old LED TV. Instructions on how to extract it [can be found on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=diy+bezel+free+kit). When youn have it, you need to cut it length-wise into 60mm strips. You will need only two, so consider giving the rest to a friend if needed. 

Fortunately, all of the other items required are easily found in any arts & crafts store. For this project, you will need:

* 2x A4 sized 5mm Foamcore board ([Get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Cathedral-A4-Foam-Board-Black/dp/B00BZ1VREG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2V4NTFSX9BVYM&amp;keywords=schaumkern%252B5%252Bmm%252Ba4&amp;qid=1682930947&amp;sprefix=foamcore%252B5mm%252Ba%252Caps%252C115&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=lovelysimraci-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=fb7b8388eb7d9eb4b6b7d215c46c81fd&camp=1638&creative=6742))
* 2x 51mm Foldback Clips (or the largest you can find) ([Get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/D-RECT-Foldback-Multi-Purpose-Writing-Supplies/dp/B07VQJ33ML/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2A8FMAP01V8AC&amp;keywords=foldback%252Bclips%252B51%252Bmm&amp;qid=1682930315&amp;sprefix=foldback%252Bclips%252B51mm%252Caps%252C107&amp;sr=8-7&amp;th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=lovelysimraci-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=fcd9ba18fde7b983a2eb46522879b562&camp=1638&creative=6742))
* 2x 100cm Elastic Shoe Lace ([Get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09KPJH188?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_1ZCY86WZX8D1SN19WG68&_encoding=UTF8&tag=lovelysimraci-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=577eb346b6609ddcc447dc004cbc6350&camp=1638&creative=6742))
* Super Glue to hold everything together ([Get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/Super-Liquid-Minis-Original-Sealed/dp/B06WWB38CW/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?crid=19TFJLCQ0KX81&amp;keywords=superkleber&amp;qid=1682931052&amp;sprefix=super%252Bglue%252Caps%252C158&amp;sr=8-3-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=lovelysimraci-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=80a2ad0b6f7d158441d53f00dabc0604&camp=1638&creative=6742))

## The Template
Download the PDF file and print it at 100% size. It is made to fit an **A4 size** page, so make sure you select the right paper size. Each page is good for a single side mount, so unless you've got a really weird setup, you will need to print out two sheets.

## Assembly
Once you've got all the pieces cut and ready, all you need to do is follow the below assmbly instructions. Use one A4 template per side.

## Tip for Perfect Fitting
:bulb: If your monitor has a lip, you can cut out a bit on either side of the fims. The idea is to get the film to sit flat on the screen. 

**Once fitted, adjust the top and bottom mounts by moving them left or right, until you find the sweet spot.**
